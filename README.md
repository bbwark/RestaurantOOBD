# RestaurantOOBD

This is the first major scale project I've developed.
It is the product of the efforts made during the journey undertaken through the Database and Object Oriented Programming courses.

The database was built in PostgreSQL and has more than 15 procedures and as many triggers, it was then connected to the application written in Java through the corresponding JDBC library, with due care also to avoid possible injection into the database by intended users to break the correct functioning of the program.
